# Style Update Rule

When updating styles for any given page, always check and update both the corresponding `[page].tsx` (such as [page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx)) and the shared layout file ([layout.tsx](mdc:app/layout.tsx)) if present. This ensures that both page-specific and layout-wide styles are consistently applied.
