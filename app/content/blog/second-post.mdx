# Building with Next.js

Next.js has been an amazing framework for building modern web applications. The App Router
brings so many great features like:

- Server Components by default
- Nested Layouts
- Server Actions
- Streaming and Suspense

I've been using it for all my new projects and loving the developer experience!
